\usage{
create_summary_data(
  Ytype,
  q = 10,
  keep = FALSE,
  family = "gaussian",
  controlsonly = "TRUE",
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{Ytype}{The relationship between X and Y; can be "linear", "quad", "sqrt", "log", "threshold" or "fracpoly"}

\item{q}{The number of quantiles.}

\item{keep}{Whether to retain the individual level data as well as the summary data}

\item{family}{a description of the error distribution and link function to be used in the model.
For piecewise_mr this can be a character string naming either the gaussian
(i.e. "gaussian" for continuous data) or binomial (i.e. "binomial" for
binary data) family function.}

\item{controlsonly}{whether to estimate the gx association in all people,
or in controls only. This is set to TRUE as default.
It has no effect if family is set to "gaussian"}

\item{...}{parameters passed to mr_create_data for control of X-Y relationship}
}
\value{
summary A data-frame containing the semi-summarised beta_X and
beta_Y values, mean of X_0, mean of X, max of X and min of X for each quantile.
