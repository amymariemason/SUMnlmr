\usage{
create_nlmr_summary(
  y,
  x,
  g,
  covar = NULL,
  family = "gaussian",
  controlsonly = TRUE,
  q
)
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{vector of outcome values.}

\item{x}{vector of exposure values.}

\item{g}{the instrumental variable.}

\item{covar}{a matrix of covariates.}

\item{family}{a description of the error distribution and link function to be used in the model.
For piecewise_mr this can be a character string naming either the gaussian
(i.e. "gaussian" for continuous data) or binomial (i.e. "binomial" for
binary data) family function.}

\item{controlsonly}{whether to estimate the gx association in all people,
or in controls only. This is set to TRUE as defau.
It has no effect if family is set to "gaussian"}

\item{q}{the number of quantiles the exposure distribution is to be split
into. Within each quantile a causal effect will be fitted, known as a
localised average causal effect (LACE). The default is deciles (i.e. 10
quantiles).}
}
\value{
model the model specifications. The first column is the number of
quantiles (q); the second column is the position used to relate x to the LACE
in each quantiles (xpos); the third column is the type of confidence
interval constructed (ci); the fourth column is the number of bootstrap
replications performed (nboot).
