\usage{
piecewise_summ_figure(
  xcoef,
  coef,
  xmean,
  lci,
  uci,
  xbreaks,
  family = "gaussian",
  ref = mean(xmean),
  pref_x = "x",

)
}
\arguments{
\item{xcoef}{the association between the exposure and the instrument.}

\item{coef}{the coefficients of the localized causal effects.}

\item{xmean}{mean of each x stratum (for plotting point estimates)}

\item{lci}{upper confidence interval range for each causal effects}

\item{uci}{upper confidence interval range for each causal effects.}

\item{xbreaks}{breakpoints in x (for plotting line estimates)}

\item{ref}{the reference point for the figure. This is the value of the function that represents the expected difference in the outcome compared with this reference value when the exposure is set to different values. The default is the mean of x.}

\item{pref_x}{the prefix/label for the x-axis. The default is "x".}

\item{pref_x_ref}{the prefix for the reference value displayed on the y-axis. The default is "x".}

\item{pref_y}{the prefix/label for the y-axis. The default is "y".}

\item{breaks}{breaks on the y-axis of the figure.}
}
\value{
the plot of the piecewise linear function.
}
\description{
piecewise_figure plots the piecewise linear function.
